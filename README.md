# parse_xlsx.py - an XLSX Cell Parser

## Why Does It Exist?  

The [Mitre ATT&CK Navigator](https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/) 
exports data to XLSX format. I needed a quick & dirty 
way to grab all the TTPs and throw them into a more 
useful format. Along the way, I learned some TTPs are 
duplicated across Tactics, so those have been removed.  

I will absolutely use the results to make something even 
dumber than this script.
